// This file used to contain a bunch of feature flag #defines
// that were populated at the compile time. Since cmake sets
// them for us we can omit them.

// Library-wide include workaround for missing types
// that are included in the upstream via pthread.h
// Since we don't use pthreads, we need to patch it in manually
